This document outlines the step-by-step process for analyzing employee data, from data cleaning to visualization in Power BI.

Step 1: Data Cleaning and Preparation
Before analysis, it is crucial to clean the data to ensure accuracy and consistency. This includes:

Checking for data inconsistencies in each column.

Identifying missing values and null values.

Verifying the correct format of the data.

Step 2: Data Cleaning Process
Once inconsistencies are identified, the data is cleaned through the following steps:

Correcting data formats where necessary.

Filling missing values using statistical methods such as mean, median, or mode.

Removing null values if they cannot be reasonably replaced.

Step 3: Loading Data into Power BI
After cleaning the data, it is loaded into Power BI for further transformation and analysis:

Checking data quality using Power BIâ€™s Transform Data feature.

Modifying data types to ensure accuracy.

Finalizing the data load into Power BI.

Step 4: Verifying Data in Table View
Once the data is loaded, we use the Table View in Power BI to confirm that the data is correctly structured and formatted.

Step 5: Data Analysis and Insights
With the cleaned and structured data, we proceed with analyzing key business metrics, including:
